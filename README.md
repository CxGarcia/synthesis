## About
Synthesis is a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) made with web technologies. It empowers music producers to make beats quickly and without having to install any software. The app's library is furnished with thousands of samples, various synthesizers, and digital effects so you can make music from a wide range of genres. If you want to play with the app, please follow this link <a href="https://cxgarcia.com/synthesis/" target="_blank">live-app</a>

## Tech Stack
![tech-stack](https://github.com/CxGarcia/synthesis/blob/master/resources/tech-stack.png)
Before moving on to the teck stack, I would like to deeply thank all the open sourcers who made this project possible. Without your passion and dedication to create such amazing software, none of this would have been possible.\ 
\
Having said this, to build the project I used the following technologies:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) on the frontend
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling
- [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) for the instruments, effects, sample fetching and management, and much more. If you don't know this library yet, it is AMAZING and very much recommended
- [Koa.js](https://koajs.com/) for the web server
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for interacting with the file system

note: the backend for this project is hosted in a different repo which you can find in the following link: [synthesis-server](https://github.com/CxGarcia/synthesis-server).


## User Interface
Here you can see the app's UI. It is composed of an instrument's library on the left and on the right there are panels to control your instruments and sequences.
